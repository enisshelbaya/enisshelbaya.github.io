	 <h3 style="text-align:center">Where it originated </h3>
	 <p>
		Haskell County, Kansas, lies in the southwest corner of the state, near Oklahoma and Colorado. In 1918 sod or mud houses were still common,
	 barely distinguishable from the treeless, dry ground they were dug out of. It had been cattle country,a now bankrupt ranch once handled 30,000 head,but Haskell farmers also raised hogs, 
	 which is one possible clue to the origin of the crisis that would terrorize the world that year-influenza. Another clue is that the county sits on a major migratory path for 17 bird species, 
	 including sand hill cranes and mallards. Scientists today understand that bird influenza viruses, like human influenza viruses, can also infect hogs, and when a bird virus and a human virus infect the same pig cell, 
	 their different genes can be shuffled and exchanged, resulting in a new type of influenza virus, perhaps even more lethal.
	 We cannot say for certain that it all started in 1918 in Haskell County, but we do know for cetain that an influenza outbreak struck in January, 
	 an outbreak so severe that, although influenza was not then a “reportable” disease, a local physician named Loring Miner, a large and imposing man, gruff,a player in local politics, who became a doctor before the acceptance of 
	 the germ theory of disease, went to the trouble of alerting the U.S. Public Health Service. The report itself no longer exists, but it stands as the first recorded notice anywhere in the world of unusual influenza activity that year.

	 <h3 style="text-align:center">Effects of the outbrake</h3>
	 <p>
		It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus,
	 and the number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide
	 with about 675,000 of them occurring in the United States alone. The pandemic was so severe
	 that from 1917 to 1918, life expectancy in the United States fell by about 12 years, to 36.6 years for men and 42.2 years for women. 
	 There were high death rates in previously healthy people, including those between the ages of 20 and 40 years old, 
	 which was unusual because flu typically hits the very young and the very old more than young adults.It is recorded as the most devastating epidemic in recorded history.

	<h3 style="text-align:center">How It spread</h3>
	<p>	Several Haskell men who had been exposed to influenza virus went to Camp Funston, in central Kansas. Days later after they arived, on March 4, the first soldier known to have influenza reported ill. 
	The huge Army base was training men for combat in World War I, and within two weeks 1,100 soldiers were admitted to the hospital, with thousands more sick in the camps barracks. Thirty eight died. 
	the infected soldiers likely carried influenza from Funston to other Army camps in the States. 24 of 36 large camps had outbreaks, sickening tens of thousands of soldiers,
	before carrying the disease overseas on board ships. Meanwhile, the disease spread into U.S. civilian communities and citys.
	</p><p>	The influenza virus mutates rapidly, changing enough that the human immune system has difficulty recognizing and attacking it even from one season to the next.
	A pandemic occurs when an entirely new and dangerous strain of the influenza virus, which the immune system has not previously seen, enters the population and spreads worldwide. 
	Ordinary seasonal influenza viruses normally bind and attack only to cells in the upper respiratory tract, such as the nose and throat, which is why they can be easily spread easily.
	The 1918 pandemic virus not only infected cells in the upper respiratory tract, enabling it
	transmitting easily, but also deep in the lungs, damaging tissue and often leading to viral as well as bacterial pneumonias, an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs.
	The 1918 flu pandemic occurred during World War I; close quarters and massive troop movements helped fuel the spread of disease.
	In the United States, unusual flu activity was first detected in military camps and some cities during the spring of 1918. For the U.S. and other countries involved
	in the war, communications about the severity and spread of disease was kept quiet as officials were concerned about keeping up public morale,
	and not giving away information about illness among soldiers during wartime. These spring outbreaks are now considered the “first wave” of the pandemic;
	illness was limited and much milder than would be observed during the two waves that followed.</p>
	<h3 style="text-align:center">Deadly Second Wave and Third Waves</h3>
	<p>In September 1918, the second wave of pandemic flu emerged at Camp Devens, a U.S. Army training camp just outside of Boston, and at a naval facility in Boston.
	This wave was brutal and peaked in the U.S. from September through November. More than 100,000 Americans died during October alone. The third and final wave began in early 1919 and ran through spring,
	causing yet more illness and death. While serious, this wave was not as lethal as the second wave. The flu pandemic in the U.S. finally subsided in the summer of 1919, 
	leaving decimated families and communities to pick up the pieces. Scientists now know this pandemic was caused by an H1N1 virus, which continued to circulate as a seasonal virus worldwide for the next 38 years and occasional attacks again.
	By the summer of 1919, the flu pandemic came to an end, as those that were infected either died or developed immunity.
	Almost 90 years later, in 2008, researchers announced they’d discovered what made the 1918 flu so deadly: 
	A group of three genes enabled the virus to weaken a victim’s bronchial tubes and lungs and clear the way for bacterial pneumonia.
	Since 1918, there have been several other influenza pandemics, although none as deadly. A flu pandemic from 1957 to 1958 killed around 2 million people worldwide, 
	including some 70,000 people in the United States, and a pandemic from 1968 to 1969 killed approximately 1 million people, including some 34,000 Americans.
	More than 12,000 Americans perished during the H1N1 (or “swine flu”) pandemic that occurred from 2009 to 2010.

	<h3 style="text-align:center">Limited Care and Control Efforts in 1918</h3>
	<p>In 1918, scientists had not yet discovered viruses so there were no laboratory tests to diagnose, detect, or characterize flu viruses. 
	Prevention and treatment methods for flu were limited. There were no vaccines to protect against flu virus infection, no antiviral drugs to treat flu illness, 
	and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia. Efforts to prevent the spread of disease were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including promotion of good personal hygiene,
	and implementation of isolation, quarantine, and closures of public settings, such as schools and theaters.
 	Some cities imposed ordinances requiring face masks in public. New York City even had an ordinance that fined or jailed people who did not cover their coughs.</p>
	<h3 style="text-align:center"></h3>
	<p>Since the 1918 pandemic, tremendous advancements have been made in the world’s understanding and treatment of flu, but flu viruses continue to pose a serious public health threat.
	A massive amount of flu viruses circulating in animals, mainly birds, pose an ever-present threat to the emergence of another flu pandemic. 
	For more than 60 years, many orginizations such as the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has worked to address the continuing threat of flu and prepare for the next pandemic.
	Flu viruses with pandemic potential can now be detected through a global influenza surveillance system that includes 114 World Health Organization member states.
	there are also 6 global influenza collaborating centers, helping to monitor and track flu activity worldwide as well as prepare candidate vaccine viruses that can be used to make vaccine.
	 public health orginizations monitor and investigate human infections with animal flu viruses. 
	There have been many ongoing studies of both human and animal flu viruses in laboratorys to better understand the characteristics of these viruses.
	Many state and local governments across the United States work with the World Health Organization (WHO) and partner countries to increase flu surveillance capabilities and collaborate on future pandemic planning.</p>
