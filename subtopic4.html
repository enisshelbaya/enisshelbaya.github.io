<h3 class="backcolor">Deadly Second Wave and Third Waves</h3>
	<p>In September 1918, the second wave of pandemic flu emerged at Camp Devens, a U.S. Army training camp just outside of Boston, and at a naval facility in Boston.
	This wave was brutal and peaked in the U.S. from September through November. More than 100,000 Americans died during October alone. The third and final wave began in early 1919 and ran through spring,
	causing yet more illness and death. While serious, this wave was not as lethal as the second wave. The flu pandemic in the U.S. finally subsided in the summer of 1919, 
	leaving decimated families and communities to pick up the pieces. Scientists now know this pandemic was caused by an H1N1 virus, which continued to circulate as a seasonal virus worldwide for the next 38 years and occasional attack again.
	By the summer of 1919, the flu pandemic came to an end, as those that were infected either died or developed immunity.
	Almost 90 years later, in 2008, researchers announced they’d discovered what made the 1918 flu so deadly: 
	A group of three genes enabled the virus to weaken a victim’s bronchial tubes<sup><a style="color:red" href="#note4">[4]</a></sup> and lungs and clear the way for bacterial pneumonia.
	Since 1918, there have been several other influenza pandemics, although none as deadly. A flu pandemic from 1957 to 1958 killed around 2 million people worldwide, 
	including some 70,000 people in the United States, and a pandemic from 1968 to 1969 killed approximately 1 million people, including some 34,000 Americans.
	More than 12,000 Americans perished during the H1N1 (“swine flu”) pandemic that occurred from 2009 to 2010.
