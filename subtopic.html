	<h1 class="backcolor">The influenza pandemic of 1918</h1>
	 <h3 class="backcolor">Where it originated </h3>
	 <p>
		Haskell County, Kansas, lies in the southwest corner of the state, near Oklahoma and Colorado. In 1918 sod or mud houses were still common,
	 barely distinguishable from the treeless, dry ground they were dug out of. It had been cattle country, a now bankrupt ranch once handled 30,000 head, but Haskell farmers also raised hogs, 
	 which is one possible clue to the origin of the crisis that would terrorize the world that year, influenza. Another clue is that the county sits on a major migratory path for 17 bird species, 
	 including sand hill cranes and mallards. Scientists today understand that bird influenza viruses, like human influenza viruses, can also infect hogs, and when a bird virus and a human virus infect the same pig cell, 
	 their different genes can be shuffled and exchanged, resulting in a mutation<sup><a style="color:red" href="#note1">[1]</a></sup> and a new type of influenza virus, perhaps even more lethal.
	 We cannot say for certain that it all started in 1918 in Haskell County, but we do know for cetain that an influenza outbreak struck in January, 
	 an outbreak so severe that, although influenza was not then a “reportable” disease, a local physician named Loring Miner, a large and imposing man, gruff,a player in local politics, who became a doctor before the acceptance of 
	 the germ theory of disease, went to the trouble of alerting the U.S. Public Health Service. The report itself no longer exists, but it stands as the first recorded notice anywhere in the world of unusual influenza activity that year.
