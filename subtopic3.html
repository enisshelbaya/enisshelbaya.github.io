<h3 class="backcolor">How it spread</h3>
	<p>	Several Haskell men who had been exposed to influenza virus went to Camp Funston, in central Kansas. Days later after they arrived, on March 4, the first soldier known to have influenza reported ill. 
	The huge Army base was training men for combat in World War I, and within two weeks 1,100 soldiers were admitted to the hospital, with thousands more sick in the camps barracks. Thirty eight died. 
	The infected soldiers likely carried influenza from Funston to other Army camps in the States. 24 of 36 large camps had outbreaks, sickening tens of thousands of soldiers,
	before carrying the disease overseas on board ships. Meanwhile, the disease spread into U.S. civilian communities and cities.
	</p><p>	The influenza virus mutates rapidly, changing enough that the human immune system has difficulty recognizing and attacking it even from one season to the next.
	A pandemic occurs when an entirely new and dangerous strain of the influenza virus, which the immune system has not previously seen, enters the population and spreads worldwide. 
	Ordinary seasonal influenza viruses normally bind and attack only to cells in the upper respiratory tract, such as the nose and throat, which is why they can be easily spread easily.
	The 1918 pandemic virus not only infected cells in the upper respiratory tract, enabling it
	to transmit easily, but also deep in the lungs, damaging tissue and often leading to viral as well as bacterial pneumonias, an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs.
	The 1918 flu pandemic occurred during World War I; close quarters and massive troop movements helped fuel the spread of disease.
	In the United States, unusual flu activity was first detected in military camps and some cities during the spring of 1918. For the U.S. and other countries involved
	in the war, communications about the severity and spread of disease was kept quiet as officials were concerned about keeping up public morale,
	and not giving away information about illness among soldiers during wartime. These spring outbreaks are now considered the “first wave” of the pandemic;
	illness was limited and much milder than would be observed during the two waves that followed.</p>
