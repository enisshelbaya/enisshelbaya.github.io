<h3 class="backcolor">Effects of the outbreak</h3>
	 <p>
		It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus,
	 and the number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide
	 with about 675,000 of them occurring in the United States alone. The pandemic<sup><a style="color:red" href="#note2">[2]</a></sup> was so severe
	 that from 1917 to 1918,that the mortality<sup><a style="color:red" href="#note3">[3]</a></sup> of certainain groups of people fell, and life expectancy in the United States fell by about 12 years, to 36.6 years for men and 42.2 years for women.  
	 There were high death rates in previously healthy people, including those between the ages of 20 and 40 years old, 
	 which was unusual because flu typically hits the very young and the very old more than young adults. It is recorded as the most devastating epidemic in recorded history.
